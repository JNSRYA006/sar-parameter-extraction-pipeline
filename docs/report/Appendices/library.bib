   abstract = {The TerraSAR-X is a German national SAR- satellite system for scientific and commercial applications. It is the continuation of the scientifically and technologically successful radar missions X-SAR (1994) and SRTM (2000) and will bring the national technology developments DESA and TOPAS into operational use. The space segment of TerraSAR-X is an advanced high-resolution X-Band radar satellite. The system design is based on a sound market analysis performed by Infoterra. The TerraSAR-X features an advanced high-resolution X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar based on the active phased array technology which allows the operation in Spotlight-, Stripmap- and ScanSAR Mode with various polarizations. It combines the ability to acquire high resolution images for detailed analysis as well as wide swath images for overview applications. In addition, experimental modes like the Dual Receive Antenna Mode allow for full-polarimetric imaging as well as along track interferometry, i.e. moving target identification. The Ground Segment is optimized for flexible response to (scientific and commercial) User requests and fast image product turn-around times. The TerraSAR-X mission will serve two main goals. The first goal is to provide the strongly supportive scientific community with multi-mode X-Band SAR data. The broad spectrum of scientific application areas include Hydrology, Geology, Climatology, Oceanography, Environmental Monitoring and Disaster Monitoring as well as Cartography (DEM Generation) and Interferometry. The second goal is the establishment of a commercial EO-market in Europe which is driven by Infoterra. The commercial goal is the development of a sustainable EO-business so that the e.g. follow-on systems can be completely financed by industry from the profit. Due to its commercial potential, the TerraSAR-X project will be implemented based on a public-private partnership with the Astrium GmbH. This paper will describe first the mission objectives as well as the project organisation and major milestones. Then an overview on the satellite as well as the SAR instrument is given followed by a description of the system design. Finally the principle layout of the TerraSAR-X Ground Segment and some remarks on the European context are presented.},

   abstract = {A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image of the advancing winter marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the Antarctic, composed of frazil-pancake ice, has been analysed in a new way in order to test the predictions of a recently developed theory of wave dispersion in pancake ice which treats the ice as a viscous layer. In the image, obtained in April 2000, the structure of the wave spectrum in the MIZ and its change from the open-water spectrum are consistent with a pancake layer 24 cm thick. Intensive in situ measurements of the pancake ice in the MIZ 280 km W of the image location were made from FS Polarstern during a period covering the satellite imaging, and also yielded a mean ice thickness of 24 cm. We conclude that this technique gives realistic results for ice thickness, whereas earlier work based on a different dispersion theory (mass loading) tended to over-estimate thickness. After further validation, it is therefore possible that the SAR wave technique can become an accepted method for monitoring ice thickness in pancake icefields.

   abstract = {Early conceptual models and global climate model (GCM) simulations both indicated the likelihood of an enhanced sensitivity to climate change in the polar regions, derived from the positive feedbacks brought about by snow and ice. As GCMs developed, however, the expected enhanced sensitivity has been more robust in the North Polar Region than the South Polar Region. Some recent increased-CO2 simulations, for instance, show little change in Southern Ocean sea ice extent and thickness and much less warming in the Southern Ocean region than in the sea ice regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Observations show a highly variable Southern Ocean ice cover that decreased significantly in the 1970s but, overall, has increased since the late 1970s. The increases are non-uniform, and in fact decreases occurred in the last three years of the 1979-2002 satellite record highlighted here. Regionally, the positive trends since the late 1970s are strongest in the Ross Sea, while the trends are negative in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas, a pattern that appears in greater spatial detail in maps of trends in the length of the sea ice season. These patterns correspond well with patterns of temperature trends, but there is a substantial way to go before they are understood (and can be modelled) in the full context of global change.},

In order to fit observations, it is shown that describing GPI as a viscous medium requires the adoption of an ice viscosity which increases with the ice thickness. The consequences regarding the possibility of ice thickness retrieval from remote sensing data of wave attenuation are discussed.

   abstract = {With the prospect of operational satellite SAR's by the end of the decade, there is a clear need to develop automated algorithms for the extraction of geophysical data about sea ice from high-resolution radar imagery. To this end, we have developed techniques for distinguishing ice from open water and for resolving the details of deformation within areas 100 km square imaged by Seasat SAR. The classification of ice and open water is based on the creation of a second band of image data consisting of the local variance of the original brightness, the first band being a local average brightness. In the space of these two variables, ice and open water are separated into two distinct clusters. The deformation is found on a 3.4-km mesh by local cross correlations of the brightness. The strategy is to find a coarse displacement field with a highly averaged image, and to proceed through a hierarchy of images with increasing resolution, improving the accuracy of the displacements at each step. Comparison with manually determined displacement shows room for improvement in regions of high deformation by using smaller areas for cross correlation. The concentration and deformation data are used together to determine localized regions of the scene where open water is produced or lost.},

   abstract = {We study the diffusion of ocean waves by ice bodies much smaller than a wavelength, such as pancakes and small ice floes. We argue that inhomogeneities in the ice cover at scales comparable to that of the wavelength significantly increase diffusion, producing a contribution to wave attenuation comparable to what is observed in the field and usually explained by viscous effects. The resulting attenuation spectrum is characterized by a peak at the scale of the inhomogeneities in the ice cover, which could explain the rollover of the attenuation profile at small wavelengths observed in field experiments. The proposed attenuation mechanism leads to the same behaviors that would be produced by a viscous wave model with effective viscosity linearly dependent on the ice thickness. This may explain recent findings that viscous wave models require a thickness-dependent viscosity to fit experimental attenuation data. Experimental validation is carried out using wave buoy attenuation data and synthetic aperture radar image analysis.},

   abstract = {Digital measures of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) image texture, as well as the local approximation to the mean value of individual ice types, were used to perform discrimination and mapping of ice types. The SAR data described in this paper were gathered in March, 1979, over the Beaufort Sea as part of the Canadian SURSAT project. Digital SAR data from a 3 X 3 km area were obtained using optical processing of the signal film and digital recording of the output image. Prior to performing the textural analysis, a digital filter algorithm was developed that minimizes the effect of radar-system-generated coherent speckle and produces an image approximating local tone while preserving edge definition. This image was used in the analysis to separate image tone from image texture. The textural analysis, which included calculating the entropy and inertia of the image, indicated that first-and multiyear, smooth-and rough-ice types could be distinguished based on the textural values obtained from the data with an overall accuracy of 65 percent. This study has also considered the use of cellular operations based upon neighborhood transfonnations to calculate the tex-tural values. This computation method can potentially reduce the time to compute textural features on a general-purpose computer to near real-time rates.},

   abstract = {<p>Sea ice plays an important role in climate change research and maritime shipping safety, and SAR imaging technology provides important technical support for sea ice extraction. However, traditional methods have limitations such as low efficiency, model complexity, and excessive human interference. For that, a novel sea ice segmentation algorithm based on a spatially constrained Gamma mixture model (GaMM) is proposed in this paper. The advantage of the proposed algorithm is automatic, efficient, and accurate sea ice extraction. The algorithm first uses GaMM to build the probability distribution of sea ice in SAR images. Considering the similarity in the class attributions of local pixels, the smoothing coefficient is defined by the class attributes of neighboring pixels. Then, the prior distribution of the label is modeled by combining Gibbs distribution and the smoothing coefficient to improve the accuracy of sea ice extraction. The proposed algorithm utilizes the Expectation maximization method to estimate model parameters, and determines the optimal number of classes using Bayesian information criteria, aiming to achieve fast and automatic sea ice extraction. To test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, numerous experiments were conducted on simulated and real high-resolution SAR images. The results show that the proposed algorithm has high accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can obtain the optimal number of classes and avoid over-segmentation or under-segmentation caused by manually setting the number of classes.</p>},

   abstract = {Icefields composed of frazil and pancake ice play important roles in both polar regions in winter. During the early to midwinter period pancake ice is a major component of the Antarctic sea ice cover, while in the Arctic the Odden ice tongue in the Greenland Sea, associated with deep convection, is composed mainly of pancake ice. The retrieval of sea ice thickness by remote sensing is, in general, a very difficult task. In this paper the change in dispersion of ocean waves as they penetrate into pancake ice is considered so as to gain insight into its possible relationship with thickness. Spectral analysis of subscenes from ERS-2 (second European Remote Sensing Satellite) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images yields the wavelength and direction of the principal spectral component both outside and inside the ice cover. There is a decrease of wavelength at the ice edge, as well as refraction toward the normal and a loss of amplitude. The analysis is complex because the true wave spectrum must be retrieved from the SAR spectrum, involving an inversion technique that requires a ''first-guess'' spectrum. This analysis technique is described, together with a newer cross-spectral technique and a discussion of the wave theories that predict the change in wavelength. Results are reported from two experiments in the Odden ice tongue, in 1993 and 1997, both of which involved surface truth measurements from ships and wave buoys. In the Antarctic, results are reported from imagery of the outer ice-edge zone of the Weddell Sea sector in midwinter (July) 1997.},

This enabled us to fully test and apply the SAR-waves technique, first developed by Wadhams and Holt (1991), for deriving the thickness of frazil-pancake icefields from changed wave dispersion. A line of subimages from a main SAR image (usually CSK) is analyzed running into the ice along the main wave direction. Each subimage is spectrally analyzed to yield a wave number spectrum, and the change in the shape of the spectrum between open water and ice, or between two thicknesses of ice, is interpreted in terms of the viscous equations governing wave propagation in frazil-pancake ice. For each of the case studies considered here, there was good or acceptable agreement on thickness between the extensive in situ observations and the SAR-wave calculation. In addition, the SAR-wave analysis gave, parametrically, effective viscosities for the ice covering a consistent and narrow range of 0.03–0.05 m2 s−1.},

The spatial distribution of crevasses on Antarctic ice shelves in 2020 was mapped with a spatial resolution of ~40 m, and the characteristics of crevasses on the Nickerson Ice Shelf, Jelbart Ice Shelf, Amery Ice Shelf, Thwaites Glacier, and Shackleton Ice Shelf were analyzed. The results indicated the extraction accuracy of our method was 84.2% and the F1 score was 72.5%. Compared with previous published studies, the identification of the crevasse areas had good visual consistency. However, in some scenes, the recall rate was relatively lower due to the quality of the SAR image, terrain surrounding the crevasses, and observation geometry. The crevasses on different ice shelves had different characteristics in terms of length, density, type, and spatial pattern, implying the different stress structures of ice shelves. The Thwaites Glacier and the Nickerson Ice Shelf in the West Antarctica Ice Sheet (WAIS) had shorter ice crevasses, whereas the lengths of ice crevasses on the Jelbart Ice Shelf and the Amery Ice Shelf in the East Antarctica Ice Sheet (EAIS) were relatively long. Nevertheless, there are more closely spaced crevasses on the ice shelf in WAIS compared to that in the EAIS. For the distribution of crevasse types, the Nickerson Ice Shelf and the Shackleton Ice Shelf had various forms of crevasses. There were mainly transverse crevasses developed on the Jelbart Ice Shelf and the Amery Ice Shelf. This study provides a helpful reference and guidance for automated crevasse extraction. The method proposed by this study manifests great application potential and the efficacy of producing a time-series crevasse data set with higher spatial resolution and larger coverage. In the future, more Sentinel-1 SAR imagery will be applied and the effect of temporal and spatial variations in crevasses on the stability of ice shelves will be investigated, which will contribute to project the ice shelf stability and explore the sea level rise implications of recent and future cryosphere changes.},

   abstract = {Gravity waves propagating on the surface of ice-covered water of finite depth are considered. The ice layer is viewed as a suspension, with an effective viscosity much greater than that of water and a density slightly less than that of water. It is treated as a viscous liquid, and the water beneath it is treated as an inviscid liquid. The linearized motion of gravity waves is analyzed for this two-layer model, and the dispersion equation is obtained. It is solved numerically for waves of any length. It is also simplified for waves short compared to the layer thickness and for waves long compared to the layer thickness. This equation yields dispersion and strong attenuation, both of which depend upon the effective viscosity of the suspension. Copyright 1998 by the American Geophysical Union.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a wave-in-ice model calibration study. Data used were collected in the thin ice of the advancing autumn marginal ice zone of the western Arctic Ocean in 2015, where pancake ice was found to be prevalent. Multiple buoys were deployed in seven wave experiments; data from four of these experiments are used in the present study. Wave attenuation coefficients are calculated utilizing wave energy decay between two buoys measuring simultaneously within the ice covered region. Wavenumbers are measured in one of these experiments. Forcing parameters are obtained from simultaneous in-situ and remote sensing observations, as well as forecast/hindcast models. Cases from three wave experiments are used to calibrate a viscoelastic model for wave attenuation/dispersion in ice cover. The calibration is done by minimizing the difference between modeled and measured complex wavenumber, using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The calibrated results are validated using two methods. One is to directly apply the calibrated viscoelastic parameters to one of the wave experiments not used in the calibration and then compare the attenuation from the model with measured data. The other is to use the calibrated viscoelastic model in WAVEWATCH III® over the entire western Beaufort Sea and then compare the wave spectra at two remote sites not used in the calibration. Both validations show reasonable agreement between the model and the measured data. The completed viscoelastic model is believed to be applicable to the fall marginal ice zone dominated by pancake ice.},

   abstract = {The satellite of the TerraSAR-X mission, called TSX, was launched on 15 June 2007 and its identically constructed twin satellite TDX, which is required by the mission TanDEM-X, launched on 21 June 2010. Together they supply high-quality radar data in order to serve two mission goals: Scientific observation of Earth and the provisioning of remote sensing data for the commercial market (TerraSAR-X mission) and the generation of a global digital elevation model (DEM) of Earth's surface (TanDEM-X mission). On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the mission, the focus will be on the development of the TerraSAR-X system during this period, including the extension of the ground segment, the evolution of the product portfolio, dedicated mission campaigns, radar experiments, refinement of the satellite operations and orbit control, and the results of the performance monitoring. Despite numerous interventions in the overall system, we managed to incorporate new scientific and commercial requirements and to improve and enhance the overall system in order to fulfill the increasing demand for Earth observation data without noticeable interruptions to ongoing operations.},
